{- | User input.

The game moves forward every half a second.
The gloss pictures are drawn at a fixed frame rate of 30 frames per second.
User input, however, arrives at unpredictable times!
This means that user input events constitute a separate clock.

rhine-gloss provides such a clock, 'GlossEventClockIO', but it ticks at every event that the gloss backend emits.
In our game of snake, we are only interested in those events where the player presses the right arrow key or the left arrow key.
Every time this happens, the event should be forwarded to the game logic,
where it should turn the direction into which the snake is heading.
