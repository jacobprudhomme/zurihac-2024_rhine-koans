Sometimes you might want to change the game.
In Rhine (and other frameworks based on monadic stream functions like dunai, bearriver, and essence-of-live-coding),
we throw and catch exceptions to switch between different signal functions.
To do this, there is a monad interface for exception-throwing signal functions, 'ClSFExcept'.

In short:

* Exceptions are effects in the 'ExceptT' monad transformer, which is added to the monad stack of the 'ClSF'.
* To enter the new 'ClSFExcept' monad context, you can use:
  * 'try :: ClSF (ExceptT e m) cl a b -> ClSFExcept cl a b m e' for switching to a 'ClSF' that may throw an exception
  * 'safe :: ClSF m cl a b -> ClSFExcept cl a b m void' for finally switching to a 'ClSF' that will never throw an exception
* To handle exceptions, use do notation:
  A 'ClSFExcept' value returns its exception, and you can then switch to the next signal function by adding a statement to the do block.
* To leave the 'ClSFExcept' context after all exceptions have been handled, use 'safely :: ClSFExcept cl a b m Void -> ClSF m cl a b'

See https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rhine/docs/FRP-Rhine-ClSF-Except.html
and section 4.2 of the original research article https://www.manuelbaerenz.de/files/Rhine.pdf for more details.

With these ingredients, we can change the game to be over!
Fix the code such that if the snake hits the boundaries or itself, the game will change to a special gameover state.
