{- | Modularize.

To make a round-based game, we need to encode the rounds in some way.
The most natural way to do this in Rhine is to define a separate clock where each tick corresponds to one round!

Let's do this here.
For the rest of this track, we will just assume that a round lasts half a second.
So we should use a @'Millisecond' 500@ clock!

The devil is in the details, though.
We now have two different components, the game clock and the visualization clock.
But they run on different monads and time domains!
You will have to translate between them in order to make everything flow together.

Some background on monads and time domains:
Have a look at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rhine/docs/FRP-Rhine-Clock.html#t:Clock.
* The type variable @m@ in @Clock m cl@ is the monad in which the clock takes side effects while ticking.
  It also determines how multiple clocks are scheduled.
  A clock can be tied to a particular monad, or be polymorphic in it.
  You can also change the monad with a 'HoistClock' (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rhine/docs/FRP-Rhine-Clock.html#t:HoistClock).
* The associated type @Time cl@ is called the /time domain/.
  It is the type of time stamps that the clock emits while ticking.
  A clock always has one fixed time domain.
  To change it, you need to create a new clock, by applying a clock rescaling:
  https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rhine/docs/FRP-Rhine-Clock.html#t:RescaledClock
