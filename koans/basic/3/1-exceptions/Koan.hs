{- | Exceptions.

Have you ever tried to use the word count application you worked with in chapter 2 as a standalone console application?
If not, now is the time to do so!
How about counting the number of lines in the source code of one of the koans?
Try this (assuming you have a Unix-like system):

```
cat koans/basic/3/1-exceptions/solution/Koan.hs | cabal run basic-2-9-modularize
```

Unfortunately, this will throw an exception:

```
basic-2-9-modularize: <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
```

The reason is that 'StdinClock' itself throws this 'IOError' as soon as the end of the file is reached.
The goal of this koan is to catch this error and handle it gracefully instead of letting it crash through.

Test it as a console application!

```
cat koans/basic/3/1-exceptions/solution/Koan.hs | cabal run basic-3-1-exceptions
```
