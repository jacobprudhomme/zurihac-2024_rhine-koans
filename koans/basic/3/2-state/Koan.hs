{- | State.

So we have a handle on exceptions.
Nevertheless, once the exception occurs, even if we handle it gracefully, the current word count is gone.
Let's fix that!

Continuing to use the koan as a console application,
we want to output the final word count of a text file at the end,
as well as an intermediate count every 1000 lines.

Note: It's important that 'StateT' is the inner transformer.
After all, we want to keep the final state after the exception has been thrown.
