{- | Asynchronize.

Our word count application is somewhat usable now,
but so far it was forced to be single threaded because of the use of 'StateT'.
Adding further clocks to it is not possible in a general state monad.

Luckily, there are other monads that can be scheduled concurrently in Rhine
which give us all the capability we need.
To track the total number of lines, words and characters,
we keep a central accumulation state which we update for every new line with an increment.
Such a state is modelled well as a monoid, so we can use the 'AccumT' monad transformer for it!
In case you haven't heard of it yet, now is a good time to familiarise yourself with it:
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers/docs/Control-Monad-Trans-Accum.html

The advantage of 'AccumT' is that it is an instance of 'MonadSchedule',
so we can use several clocks in this monad and schedule them.
Let's use this to change the word count application slightly such that it doesn't output a running count on every 1000 lines,
but instead every second! This means adding a Millisecond 1000 clock, and printing on every tick of it.
